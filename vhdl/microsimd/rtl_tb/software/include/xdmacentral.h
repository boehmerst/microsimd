* @file xdmacentral.h
*
* This header file contains prototypes of high-level driver function that can
* be used to access the Central DMA device on the OPB or the PLB bus.
*
*
* <b>DESCRIPTION</b>
*
* Central DMA is a standalone IP core, as opposed to a DMA channel component
* distributed in devices.
*
* Central DMA allows a CPU to minimize the CPU interaction required to move
* data between a memory and a device.  The CPU requests the Central DMA to
* perform a DMA operation and typically continues performing other processing
* until the DMA operation completes.  DMA could be considered a primitive form
* of multiprocessing such that caching and address translation can be an issue.
*
* A feature the Central DMA device contains is supporting different data
* sizes used in each data transfer on the bus.
* Currently data sizes of Byte, Half word (2 bytes) and Word ( 4 bytes) are
* supported by OPB Central DMA device, data sizes of Double word (8 bytes) and
* Word (4 bytes) are supported by PLB Central DMA, and data size of word
* (4 bytes).is supported by XPS Central DMA.
*
*
* !!! Using invalid transfer data size may cause unexpected results !!!
*
* Please be aware that in OPB Central DMA, only Word data size supports
* Keyhole addressing.
*
* Another difference between PLB/XPS Central DMA and OPB Central DMA is that Bus
* Timeout bit in status register is supported only in OPB Central DMA. The bit
* is not defined in PLB/XPS Central DMA.
*
* The user should refer to the hardware device specification for more
* details of the device operation.
*
*
* <b>CONFIGURATION</b>
*
* The Central DMA device supports a parameter, C_READ_OPTIONAL_REGS, at
* hardware design time. The Source Address register, Destination Address
* register, DMA Control register and Interrupt Enable register are:
*
*   - write only if C_READ_OPTIONAL_REGS = 0
*   - readable/writable if C_READ_OPTIONAL_REGS = 1
*
* If the application needs to read the contents of these register, it is
* the responsibility of the application developer to make sure the hardware
* parameter mentioned above is set to 1. This could be done by checking
* data member, ReadOptionalRegs, in the device configuration structure
* XDmaCentral_Config defined in xdmacentral.h. Note that the registers above
* are readable/writable if ReadOptionalRegs equals TRUE, write only if
* ReadOptionalRegs equals FALSE.
*
* This driver does not maintain the current states of these registers. It is
* the responsibility of the application to manage those states if needed.
*
*
* <b>INTERRUPTS</b>
*
* Central DMA has the ability to generate an interrupt. It is the
* responsibility of the caller of DMA functions to manage the interrupt
* including connecting to the interrupt and enabling/disabling the interrupt.
*
*
* <b>CRITICAL SECTIONS</b>
*
* This driver does not use critical sections and it does access registers using
* read-modify-write operations.  Calls to DMA functions from a main thread
* and from an interrupt context could produce unpredictable behavior such that
* the caller must provide the appropriate critical sections.
*
*
* <b>ADDRESS TRANSLATION</b>
*
* All addresses of data structures which are passed to DMA functions must
* be physical (real) addresses as opposed to logical (virtual) addresses.
*
*
* <b>CACHING</b>
*
* The caller of DMA functions is responsible for ensuring that any data
* buffers which are passed to the Central DMA have been flushed from the cache.
*
* The caller of DMA functions is responsible for ensuring that the cache is
* invalidated prior to using any data buffers which are the result of a DMA
* operation.
*
*
* <b>MEMORY ALIGNMENT</b>
*
* The addresses of data buffers which are passed to DMA functions must be
* multiples of the data size currently used by the Central DMA hardware.
* Data size could be set by using DMA functions provided in this driver.
* The caller of this driver should refer to the device specification for
* more details.
*
*
* <b>MUTUAL EXCLUSION</b>
*
* The functions of the Central DMA are not thread safe such that the caller
* of all DMA functions is responsible for ensuring mutual exclusion for a
* Central DMA device.  Mutual exclusion across multiple Central DMA device is
* not necessary.
*
* The user should refer to the hardware device specification for more
* details of the device operation.
